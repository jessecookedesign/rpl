# Basics
## What is RPL?
RPL stands for Responsys Personalization Language.

At its core, RPL is designed to generate HTML and Text for emails built in Responsys Interact. Although Responsys documentation says it's "not a full-blown programming language", it does have a lot of programming capabilties.


## How does RPL work?
Generally, RPL is added to HTML to pull data from various data sources inside Responsys before the email ships.

It can also be used to do a number of things like:
- if-else statements
- reference links in a link table
- pass data to a link table
- assign variables
- parse XML or JSON data
- do math
- check values
- etc
